# ðŸŒ¿ Cotton Plant Health Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Cotton Plant Health Classification** project uses **deep learning** and **computer vision** to detect and classify common diseases in cotton plants from leaf images.  
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained to identify whether a leaf is healthy or affected by a specific disease, helping farmers take timely action to protect crops.
