# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Classifier
This project is a **deep learning-based image classification system** that identifies whether a cotton plant leaf is **healthy** or **diseased**.   It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze images and can assist farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection, reducing crop losses and improving yield.
